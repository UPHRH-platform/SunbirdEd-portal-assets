NIRAMAYA session cookies are used to store URLs in order to better redirect users to the right pages. For example, when a User signs-in to NIRAMAYA from the courses page, they'll need to be redirected back to the courses page at the end of sign-in for a cleaner user experience. Session cookies are also used to store whether to use the Content Delivery Network (CDN) to pull images, plugins and other assets that are shown on the user interface. This is to enable faster loading of the pages the User interacts with. No personal information, or user preferences are stored in cookies.

                  Users can clear their cookies by going to their browser settings and clearing their browsing data (by specifically checking off the option to clear cookies). Doing so, does not impact their user experience on NIRAMAYA as usage of NIRAMAYA sets the cookies again. Users can also choose to block cookies from the settings as well. Doing so, will mean that certain things on NIRAMAYA will not function properly. For eg., images/plugins may take a long time to load and the user will not be taken to the right pages after login.

          <label class="tagLine"><em>( Last updated on <b>25-10-2021</b> )</em></label>
          <p>
            This Content Policy sets out the guidelines for content to be followed
            on NIRAMAYA. The NIRAMAYA Strategy and Approach Paper clearly articulates
            one of the intentions of NIRAMAYA - to create a common repository of open
            education resources for easy access to teachers across the country. This
            Content Policy sets out the principles and process to achieve this end.
          </p>
          <p>
            The content creation and curation process on NIRAMAYA is envisaged to be
            an open process with low barriers to entry. It celebrates and encourages
            participation by making it simple to create and share content on the
            platform. It avoids creating barriers to entry in the form of
            centralized review workflows and federates that process to the community
            to police itself. Institutional Users, through their Administrators,
            being the custodians of NIRAMAYA, frame the guidelines and curation rules,
            and delegate the authority to curate to the community. This creates a
            platform that is open, has low barrier to entry, while the quality of
            content is ensured by the federated process.
          </p>
          <p>
            Set out below are some common-sense rules that all Users must comply
            with respect to Content on NIRAMAYA. These rules are to be taken seriously
            as Administrators are required to enforce the same strictly. Users are
            requested not to look for loopholes or ways around these guidelines and
            respect the spirit in which they have been created.
          </p>
          <p>
            Please read this Content Policy carefully, to learn more about the rules
            on appropriateness, accuracy, intellectual property rights and licensing
            that govern Content on NIRAMAYA.
          </p>
          <p>
            This Content Policy should be read in conjunction and together with the
